(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learned by Listening to Mr Tansley and by making educated guesses and experimenting with coding, which was very effective, as my calculator was a little different to the one that Mr Tansley showed us, but did exactly the same thing.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It all went very well and I was able to make a working calculator, but I could have coded it much faster instead of typing in instructions into most cells.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make sure that I use a technique which allows me to get lots of the cells to do the same thing without typing in instructions to each one.</td>
