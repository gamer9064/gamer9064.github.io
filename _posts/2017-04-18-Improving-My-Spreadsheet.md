Improving My Spreadsheet

This week I improved my spreadsheet and fixed silly little things that made it harder to use.   

At the start of the lesson I had quite a lot of experience from previous lessons, and I learned by experimenting and trial and error.

 My learning was limited because I didn't type in the full command, so if I didn't sell any of the items, then in the profit, it would show up as a loss, instead of no profit.Next time I will make sure that I type in the full command to avoid false results.
