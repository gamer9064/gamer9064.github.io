Learning How To Add Spreadsheets Into My Blogs

I had no experience prior to todays lesson.

I learned by listening to Mr Tansleys presentation and by some advice from Vandan Somani.

I have succesfully learned how to put spreadsheets into my blogs, and you can see mine below.

I do not think that I could have improved my learning, however it would be nice if I could learn how to change the size of my spreadsheets.
