Making My Blog look even better than it did last week

At the start of this lesson I had a little bit of knowledge from last week. I think that I have achieved my Target of making my blog look even better

I learned by researching and reading some information which was on Google Classroom.

My learning was limited as I accidently coded the containers wrong, so they disappeared, so I had to re-code them.

Next week I will make sure that I am coding the right things in the right places.
