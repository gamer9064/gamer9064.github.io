Today I improved my repl.it project. 

I made the conversation work without any errors, and I also managed to make the conversation more sophisticated.

I am very happy with the outcome of this lesson, and I am happy with my conversation so far, and I can't wait until next week when I will be making a Buzz feed style repl.it
