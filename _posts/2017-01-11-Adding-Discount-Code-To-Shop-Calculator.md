Adding A Discount Code To My Github

At the start of the lesson I had a little bit of knoweledge form last week, but I was not completely sure on how to get the discouynt code to actually work.

I learned by asking Mr Tansley for help and from advice from Ben cross.

My learning was limited by me not knowing exactly yhow to get the code to work, however I dont think that I could have done anything to improve.
