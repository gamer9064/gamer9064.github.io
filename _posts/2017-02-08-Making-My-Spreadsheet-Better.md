In todyas lesson, I Improved my spreadsheet, by making it a bit easier to use. 

I did do by adding another section whicvh has drop down arrows which let you select the item which you would like to buy. You can also type what you want in the boxes as wel, to make it even easier.

Mhy learning was limited as I didn't know how to make sucah a thing at the start of the lesson, however, thanks to Mr Tansleys presentation, I was able to make it on my spreadsheet as well.

Next lesson, I dont think that I would do anyhting different, as I am very happy with th eoutcome of this lesson, and I dont think that I could have done it any better.
