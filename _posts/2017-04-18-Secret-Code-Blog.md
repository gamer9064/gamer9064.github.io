Today I made a sheet with ben cross that can translate english into code. It can also turn code into english. 

At the start of the lesson we had a bit of knowledge, but we learned more through experimentation, V lookup knowledge helped us a lot.

We worked very well, and i don't think that we could have improved our learning this lesson.
