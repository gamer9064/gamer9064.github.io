Today we learned how to code on python 3 on repl.it

I almost managed to code a program where  you can have a virtual conversation, but sadly I didnt have time to finish it. 

It will be very cool and can ask questions and respond 

Sadly  this is limited to how i have programmed it, so in future lessons i plan to program it to make the conversation more sophisticated
